<p align="center">This app calculates the plant-available nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), potassium (K<sub>2</sub>O), and sulfur (S) nutrient credits (i.e. fertilizer value) of manure from various livestock species that are applied to cropland fields. The app also calculates the N credit available to crops that follow forage legumes in the rotation.

    Manure Nutrient Credits
</h3>

        <p>To access this portion of the app, select either <u>Analyzed Nutrient Content</u> or <u>Average Nutrient Content</u> from the Side Menu, which you can access by either <i>swiping right</i>, or by tapping the button on the <i>top left</i> of the screen.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p><u>Analyzed Nutrient Content</u> is used when the manure has been analyzed by a laboratory for its nutrient content.</p>
        
        <p><ol>
            <li>Select the manure source (livestock species and liquid or solid form).</li>
            <li>Select one of the three categories for the time from application to incorporation of the manure.</li>
            <li>Enter the reported lab values for either <i>total</i> or <i>available</i> N, P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>O, and S from the lab report.<sup>(1,2)</sup></li>
            <li>Choose the manure application rate by tapping the <b>[- +]</b> buttons to raise or lower the values.</li>
        </ol></p>
        
        <p>Your calculated nutrient credits from this manure application are displayed at the bottom of the screen. These credits should be subtracted from the base (unadjusted) fertilizer recommendations for the field receiving this manure.</p>
        
        <p><sup>1</sup>If the <i>total</i> nutrient content is entered, the app will covert these values to <i>available</i> nutrient content automatically. Likewise, if the <i>available</i> nutrient content of the manure is entered, the equivalent <i>total</i> nutrient content of the manure sample will be displayed.</p>
        
        <p><sup>2</sup>If manure nutrient content values need to be changed at any time, tap the <b>Reset</b> button in the center of the screen to clear the nutrient content displays.</p>
        
        <br />
        <p><u>Average Nutrient Content</u> is used when the manure has <i>not</i> been analyzed by a laboratory for its nutrient content. When this is the case, the typical nutrient contents (also called book values) based on lab analysis averages will be used.<sup>(1)</sup></p>
        
        <p><ol>
            <li>Select the manure source (livestock species and liquid or solid form).</li>
            <li>Select one of the three categories for the time from application to incorporation of the manure.</li>
            <li>Choose the manure application rate by tapping the <b>[- +]</b> buttons to raise or lower the values.</li>
        </ol></p>
        
        <p>Your calculated nutrient credits from this manure application are displayed at the bottom of the screen. These credits should be subtracted from the base (unadjusted) fertilizer recommendations for the field receiving this manure.</p>
        
        <p><sup>1</sup>Manure nutrient content can vary greatly; manure analysis is encouraged.</p>
        <br />


<h3 align="center">Legume Nitrogen Credits</h3>

        <p>To access this portion of the app, select <u>Legume Credits</u> from the Side Menu, which you can access by either <i>swiping right</i>, or by tapping the button on the <i>top left</i> of the screen.</p>
        
        <p><ol>
            <li>Select the forage legume crop (Alfalfa or Red Clover/Birdsfoot Trefoil).</li>
            <li>Select the soil texture of the field (Medium/Fine Soils or Sand).</li>
            <li>Select the density of the legume stand at the time of termination.<sup>(1,2)</sup></li>
            <li>Select the amount of plant regrowth present at the time the legume crop is killed.<sup>(3)</sup></li>
        </ol></p>
        
        <p>The legume-N nutrient credit available to the crop that follows in the rotation is displayed at the bottom of the screen. This amount should be subtracted from the base (unadjusted) N fertilizer recommendation.</p>
        
        <p><sup>1</sup>A <u>good</u> stand of alfalfa is 70% or more alfalfa (> 4 plants/ft<sup>2</sup>); a <u>fair</u> stand is 30-70% alfalfa (1.5-4 plants/ft<sup>2</sup>); a <u>poor</u> stand is less than 30% alfalfa (&lt; 1.5 plants/ft<sup>2</sup>).</p>
        
        <p><sup>2</sup>A second year N credit of 50 lb N/acre is released following a good or fair legume stand on medium- and fine-textured soils. There is no second year credit on sands.</p>
        
        <p><sup>3</sup>Method of killing the forage stand (tillage, herbicide, winter kill) does not affect the N credit.</p>
