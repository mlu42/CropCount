In this text file, I keep track of bugs that need to be fixed.

Bugs to fix:

	- Android OS keeps keyboard on when activity changes
	- Still needs a launcher icon
	- The hints for the inputs need to be changed
	- Crashes when inputting into corn price (when inputting a decimal manually)
	- Doesn't fill entire screen on large screen
